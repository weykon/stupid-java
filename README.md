## REPO

This repo is not to talk about the base syntax game, just keep a record of the project in work.

but, there are lots of taunts on too much Word concept for JAVA zoology.

Originally, it was possible to get more and better understanding, but in the end it became casual and bitter because of the loss of standards, which made developers spend a lot of time entering this so-called JAVA world, which is full of names of various people and technologies. What started out as a goal of optimizing conceptual understanding for graphical purposes, becomes increasingly impossible to understand.
